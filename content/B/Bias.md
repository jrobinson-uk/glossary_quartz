> Bias refers to a preference for or against something. For example, a student might prefer English lessons to maths lessons and spend more time on their English homework. In other words, they have a bias towards the subject of English. There are many types of bias, including societal bias and data bias. [[Machine learning]] (ML) developers have to think carefully about whether the data they are using to train ML models is biased or not. Being biased can result in giving an advantage to a person, group, or set of ideas or beliefs compared with another.
