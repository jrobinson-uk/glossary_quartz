> The [[artificial intelligence]](AI) project lifecycle refers to the different steps it might take to design and build a [[machine learning]] (ML) model. The steps include defining the problem, preparing the data, training the model, testing the model, evaluating the model, and explaining the model. For example, an ML model is designed to generate new song playlists. An ML developer might first consider what type of playlist they want to create. Next, they might collect and prepare song data. The ML model is trained and tested with the song data. The ML model is evaluated to see if it works as expected. Finally, the ML model is explained so that others can use it. Usually, the AI project lifecycle steps are used iteratively rather than one after the other. The AI project lifecycle is a series of iterative steps used to build and improve an ML  model.
