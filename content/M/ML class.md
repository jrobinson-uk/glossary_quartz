> To train classification models, [[machine learning]] (ML) developers organise the data into predefined groups called classes. Classes are defined in advance based on what people find useful to group things into. Imagine an ML application designed to identify fruits in a supermarket. The data might be organised in classes of apples, bananas, oranges, blueberries, etc. A class is a group of things that classification models use to identify similarities in the data.
