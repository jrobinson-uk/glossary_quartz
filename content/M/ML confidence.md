> Confidence refers to how certain something is. In machine learning (ML), confidence is a way of measuring the certainty of a prediction. For example, a classification model is designed to predict if it will rain tomorrow. The model predicts with 90% confidence that there will be rain tomorrow. In other words, there is a 90% certainty that tomorrow it will rain. Using confidence to measure the certainty of predictions helps to evaluate the quality of an ML model.
