> Classification refers to the task of assigning things into predefined groups, called classes. Classes are defined in advance based on what people find useful to group things into. An example of a classification problem is sentiment analysis of song reviews. A [[machine learning]] (ML) classification model is trained with reviews labelled by people as ‘positive’ or ‘negative’. After training, the ML model can be used to predict whether a new review should be classified as either ‘positive’ or ‘negative’. A classification model predicts one or more class labels. A classification approach is useful for solving problems where the answer falls into predefined groups.
