> Accuracy refers to how correct something is. In [[Machine learning]] (ML), accuracy is a way of measuring how often an ML [[model]] is making a correct [[prediction]]. For example, a [[classification]] model is designed to classify apples. From 100 images of apples, 90 are classified correctly. The classification accuracy of the model is 90%. Accuracy is one way to evaluate ML models. Most often, accuracy is used along with other measures to evaluate the quality of a model.
