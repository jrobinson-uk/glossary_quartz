> Machine learning (ML) is an approach used to design and build [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) systems. ML is said to ‘learn’ by using examples in the form of data, instead of executing step-by-step instructions. In other words, ML applications are data-driven. For example, an ML application is used to recognise speech. It is based on many examples of people speaking in different accents and tones of voice. Other ML applications include identifying objects in images or playing complex games. Each ML application is designed to solve a specific problem.
