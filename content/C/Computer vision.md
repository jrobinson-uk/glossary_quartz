> Computer vision is the study of systems designed to process information from digital images or videos. Computer vision application examples include facial recognition, medical imaging, and video surveillance. For example, computer vision is used in the design of self-driving cars to detect and avoid crashing into objects. Most often, computer vision systems use [[machine learning]] models to identify patterns in the image and video data. Computer vision systems are useful where information from digital images or videos can be used to solve a problem.
